# LectureNotesBonn

Here you can find all lecture notes I typed during my master studies at the university Bonn. This basically is every lecture where the lecturer didn't provide typed lecture notes themselves. At the moment, this includes:

**summer term 2023** 
- Introduction to Derived Categories by PD Dr. Thorsten Heidersdorf

**winter term 2023/24** (in progress)
- Algebraic Topology I by Prof. Dr. Markus Hausmann
- Ã‰tale Cohomology by Prof. Dr. Jens Franke
- Group Rings of Infinite Groups by Prof. Dr. Giles Gardam (Update 26.10.23: discontinued since there are official lecture notes now)
- Hodge Theory by Prof. Dr. Philip Engel

Obviously, these are my own notes and are not connected to the lecturer in any way. I don't guarantee completeness or correctness. If you find any mistakes, please let me know.
